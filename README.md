## Configuration and Setup

In order to run this project locally, simply fork and clone the repository or download as zip and unzip on your machine.

* Open the file in your preferred code editor.
* Go to terminal -> New terminal (in case of VS code)
  
In the terminal (make sure to navigate to the project's root directory in case it is not already), run the following commands:
```
npm install
npm run build
```
This installs all the dependencies and then creates a production-ready version of the application. 
After the build process completes, you will find the output in a directory named "dist". This directory contains all the files needed to deploy your application.

Now, open your Chrome browser and:

* Click on the extensions menu and select "Manage Extensions"
* On the extensions page, click on the "Developer Mode" toggle if not already in Developer Mode, and out of the new options available, select "Load unpacked"
* Navigate to the application's "dist" folder created earlier and select it.

Open a new tab in your Chrome browser and voil√†! the Digital NoticeBoard should be up and running :tada:.
